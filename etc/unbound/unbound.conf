#send queries for "*.internal.net" to authoritative server at 10.0.0.1.  If we want to send queries for "*.internal.net" to a recursive (non authoritative) server then use another 'forward-zone' section instead.  Remember to set 'private-address' entries appropriately otherwise no internal address information is returned.  E.g. comment out 'private-address' directives if you expect DNS responses to contain IP's in those values.
#  stub-zone:
#    name: internal.net
#    stub-addr: 10.0.0.1
#forward all other queries to google DNS
#  forward-zone:
#    name:"."
#    forward-addr: 8.8.8.8
